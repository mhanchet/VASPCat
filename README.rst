What is it?
-----------

VaspCat is a Python package for generating VASP files from crystal geometry 
input.  The program is currently capable of generating POSCAR and POTCAR 
files, but will eventually be able to generate INCAR, KPOINTS, and pbs.in
files as well.  By modifying the 'extend' directory, extra functionality
can easily be added to the package.
